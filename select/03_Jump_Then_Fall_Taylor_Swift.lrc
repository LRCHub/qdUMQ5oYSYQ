[00:24.66] I like the way I can't keep my focus
[00:27.71] I watch you talk, you didn't notice
[00:30.85] I hear the words but all I can think is we should be together
[00:36.85] Every time you smile, I smile
[00:39.73] And every time you shine, I'll shine for you

[02:28.43] I'll catch you, I'll catch you
[02:30.94] When people say things that bring you to your knees
[02:34.78] I'll catch you
[02:36.66] The time is gonna come when you're so mad, you could cry
[02:42.59] But I'll hold you through the night until you smile
